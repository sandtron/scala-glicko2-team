# TODO

## 1.0

- ~~Only support CSV, leave HSQL code for now~~
- Make README actually useful
- ~~make standalone jar~~
  - ~~create simple .sh~~
- ~~implement decay(happens when a player does not play for a while)~~
- clean up general code(logging, proper structuring of code (dateformatter))


## Near Future

- figure out benefit of using hsql...
- implement writeStore for Csv
  - implement active gplayer csv
- clean up and actually use HSQL implementation
- make implementations actaully efficient instead of loading everything into memory...
- implement command line args
  - CSV path, algorithm, decay time
- refactor CSV code to be more functional and use it as a base for future *SQL implementations

## Far Future

- think of different GUI implementations
- depending on development, consider using a proper db library(Hibernate, or something good)
